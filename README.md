This is a solution to the HackerRank Roads and Libraries challenge:

I'm trying to use the most pure DFS/BFS algorithms as possible and especially focused on KISS principle.

Although I'd rather `yarn` this project is using `npm`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hesenger/roads-libs.git
cd roads-libs
npm install
npm test
```
